Problem statement
Given File 'startup_funding.csv'

Check the trend of investments over the years. To check the trend, find -

Total number of fundings done in each year.

Plot a line graph between year and number of fundings. Take year on x-axis and number of fundings on y-axis.

Print year-wise total number of fundings also. Print years in ascending order.

Note :
There is some error in the 'Date' feature. Make sure to handle that.

Output Format :
year1 TotalFunding1
year2 TotalFunding2

"""Given File 'startup_funding.csv'

Find out which cities are generally chosen for starting a startup.

Find top 10 Indian cities which have most number of startups ?

Plot a pie chart and visualise it.

Print the city name and number of startups in that city also.

Note :
Take city name "Delhi" as "New Delhi".

Check the case-sensitiveness of cities also. That means - at some place, instead of "Bangalore", "bangalore" is given. Take city name as "Bangalore".

For few startups multiple locations are given, one Indian and one Foreign. Count those startups in Indian startup also. Indian city name is first.

Print the city in descending order with respect to the number of startups.

Output Format :
city1 number1
city2 number2
